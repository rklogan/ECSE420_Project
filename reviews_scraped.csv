B07PDHT5X,Chadd H.,4.5,"November 21, 2018",true,Anything less then a 4 Star Review is insane!!!,"Honestly I'm seeing such low reviews for this product and it drives me crazy lol...Alexa isn't going to make a sandwich for you or put your kids to bed! Maybe expectations are a little high lol......  I received my 3 Echo Dot devices for the Black Friday Special...and I'm ready to order 3 more! Installation was incredibly easy, pairing echo dots in groups was incredibly easy, setting reminders, playing Spotify, CBC News briefing, everything is incredible! If your in doubt honestly you will not regret buying these! The packaging is even gorgeous. Sound is great. I have two on my main floor living... Ask Alexa to set volume to 4 or 5 and your rocking! I've been a heavy smart phone user for years, I've had apple, Siri is junk, Google assistant mehhhh... but Alexa.... amazing! Feels like part of the family lol... All jokes aside you will not be disappointed with this purchase!",567
B07PDHT5X,Patrice,5.0,"November 3, 2018",true,Good introduction to our robot overlords,"Decent sound for something the size of a hockey puck. Pretty handy i must say. Keep it in the kitchen, good for timers music, conversions, weather and asking general or even area specific. questions etc. I was surprised how well it picks up voice. Wife still basically can’t fight the instinct to yell at it like an overseas call. My two year old somehow gets her to play whitney houston consistency even though she is speaking gibberish. I’m starting to think its an actual language that only alexa understands. Some free advice: never ask it to play hide and seek, it will never shut up, be warned. Would reccomend to people who aren’t afraid of robots eventually taking over the world. I think it would be a bit overwhelming for my mom’s generation.(no offence to you oldr folks). Thumbs up.",343

Je dois dire que j ai eu de la difficulté due as une erreur de mots de passe de ma part. A moi la faute mais réparer cette erreur n as pas été chose facile après deux appelles aux service technique ça fonctionné. Merci a eux. Ma plus grande déception  a été de voir que je ne pouvais pas faire grand choses avec Alexia. Quand j ai demander ecouter ma musique elle a lancer essais gratuit sur amazon.Donc une fois les 14 jours terminer.Je ne pourrais pas écouter de musique sauf si je paye de la musique que j ai déjà. Pourquoi pas les fameux skills  et bien la coût de génie . Le canada pour votre information est bilingue Anglais et français. Ma province le québec est une des plus grande province et elle est unilingue FRANÇAISE . Vos skills pour le canada français sont presque inexistant a part les flashs de radio canada. ça rend votre Alexa très démunie. Pourtant en france il y as des skill géniaux encore la quelle deception . Je ne peux pas les activer car je suis au canada.

During the Apple TV setup you're asked if you're okay with them collecting analytics. The Allow and Don't Allow buttons are the same size and it's up to you to decide. Amazon does not do this. They hide the ability to disable analytics deep in the settings where I bet the average user wouldn't find it.,233

It turned out to be right decision as I was able to not only convert my older HDTV into Smart TV, but it also opened door for lots of content including Amazon Prime Video. It should be noted that Amazon Prime Video is totally free for Amazon Prime Members. Now, most of people have 4K UHD TV and considering lots of content is now available in 4K, there was quite an urgent need for having an update to Basic version of Fire TV which only supported 1080p-full HD to 4K version in the same small form factor. I am glad that Amazon has released this much awaited and anticipated update in Canada. I am also using Amazon Echo Dot and there are few more Alexa compatible devices in home so updated remote with Alexa support is another welcome update.

Set up was very easy - Just connect stick to power port and HDMI port of TV, enter WI-Fi password and after software update, Amazon Fire TV stick was ready to use in minutes. It even asked me if I want to set up parental controls. It asked me to press Volume Up and Down buttons which in turn successfully paired my TV to the remote and now I can control TV with Amazon remote. The stick came pre-registered to my name and Amazon Account. I didn’t need to do any account set up. I just chose my Amazon account and everything was ready in few minutes.

B07SXJCVZ,Matthew V.,5.0,"November 20, 2019",true,Worst online in any Nintendo game,"I mean the game is pretty easy... you don't even need to force your small furry companions to engage in mortal combat for your enjoyment if you aren't into that kind of thing. You can just go around throwing different balls at animals entrapping them like some kleptomania crazed child. They seem to be running out of names for things since most of the ""pocket monsters"" in this game look exactly like what they are. Take for example ""Combee"" which is literally a honeycomb with bees in it... Reaaaaalllll original Nintendo! If you can get over the fact that if you just literally walk from place to place catching pokemon and levelling up your whole squad untill they are so beefy they can one-hit assassinate anything you come across you will probably beat the game fairly easily... but like... POKEMANS!!!",3

B0144NYGJ,Likes to listen to radio,4.6,"December 15, 2016",true,WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS!!!!,"Here’s my crazy story that I know is hard to believe but it’s all true.  I purchased this product from Amazon and tried to install it on my computer.  It didn’t work so I called the customer service number on the back of the box.  They explained why it didn’t work, offered to get a refund from Amazon for us, and then sold us a downloadable version instead.  That’s when things went funny.  It started with them claiming they charged us $300 instead of $30.  So they said they’d refund us the money, but it wasn’t working on our credit card.  So let’s try our online banking instead.  We figured we were dealing with Norton so weren’t too concerned about giving them remote access to our banking info.  They said they’d try $100 first to make sure it worked.  That resulted in them “accidentally” depositing $10,000 in our bank account.  We saw the bank account increase by that amount, but now there’s no record of it anywhere.  And through a crazy sequence of events which would be too arduous to try to explain here, we are now missing $10,000 out of our bank account.  We have contacted the police and the anti-fraud hotline.  How this scam could have come from calling Norton, we simply can’t wrap our heads around, but BE CAREFUL!!!!  If things seem suspicious, stop what you’re doing.  We have no idea what further steps we can take with this, but if this warning helps anyone else I’ll be happy.",28
B0144NYGJ,mom24,5.0,"August 8, 2019",true,Great product but cancel the automated renewal as soon as you install,"I have been using Norton antivirus for a very long time and have never had a complaint except cost fore the automated renewal. As soon as you install this software on your first device, the clock starts ticking. You need to register and give them a credit card number if you don't have an account with them to do the install. Once you have registered with Norton, just access your account and cancel the automated renewal so that you won't get a surprise a year from when you first installed. In a year from now, just order Norton from Amazon (at about half the price of the renewal) and go through the procedure again. For me at least, it's worth it.",37
B0144NYGJ,mom24,1.0,"August 8, 2019",true,It works.. but unnecessarily complicated,My computer has not been infected with a virus while using Norton. That is about the only good thing I can say.. and to be fair - it is important.,4

Location matters.... you can install it on five devices but since I bought the product on amazon.ca then I have to be in Canada to do the installation due to IP location settings.

B0144NYGJ,Amazon Customer,4.0,"September 23, 2019",true,Norton Security Deluxe from Amazon.ca is a good buy and has excellent reviews.,"It's hard to support this product with great reviews.  The product itself is fine, but the marketing of the products and the marketing trickery is off-putting.  For example, if you download before the end of your subscription, you will lose the remaining days of your paid subscription.  Also, all the come-ons from Norton urging you to renew should be resisted. Steel up your nerves and watch Amazon for a deal on Norton, then download it, and do not activate until the very last moment, and don't buy directly from the Norton website as this will be the most expensive option.",0
