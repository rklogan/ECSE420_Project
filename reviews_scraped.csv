B0791Z1G6,Jamie Munro,5.0,"January 29, 2019",true,"Update,  problems fixed but many remain, ordered 4k one, hope its better.",Update: Amazon called me about this review and I was reminded of something - the reason this thing is cheap is because Amazon records EVERYTHING YOU WATCH. During the Apple TV setup you're asked if you're okay with them collecting analytics. The Allow and Don't Allow buttons are the same size and it's up to you to decide. Amazon does not do this. They hide the ability to disable analytics deep in the settings where I bet the average user wouldn't find it.,233
B0791Z1G6,Jamie Munro,2.0,"January 29, 2019",true,The Fire TV Stick is so underrated - very impressed.,"Okay my issue was that the account's primary address was a U.S address.  Agent switched it to Canadian.  Now stuck with many U.S apps still.  Like crackle despite going to the USA and using a registration via thier isp, was successful the app remains unpopulated.  Crackle worked in Canada since it's inception,  till last year.  Why not now?  Sony is the Content rights holder and owner of the app.  So what gives?",216

B079QH9GG,TR,4.6,"November 27, 2018",true,Pleased with Audio and Video upgrades and Alexa controlled remote,"When Amazon launched Amazon Fire TV stick-Basic Edition in Canada in November 2017, I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be right decision as I was able to not only convert my older HDTV into Smart TV, but it also opened door for lots of content including Amazon Prime Video. It should be noted that Amazon Prime Video is totally free for Amazon Prime Members. Now, most of people have 4K UHD TV and considering lots of content is now available in 4K, there was quite an urgent need for having an update to Basic version of Fire TV which only supported 1080p-full HD to 4K version in the same small form factor. I am glad that Amazon has released this much awaited and anticipated update in Canada. I am also using Amazon Echo Dot and there are few more Alexa compatible devices in home so updated remote with Alexa support is another welcome update. Amazon claims that new Fire TV Stick 4K is company’s most powerful streaming stick to date.",558
B079QH9GG,Darlene Pelletier,5.0,"November 6, 2018",true,Works with Prime in Canada (with caveats),"I pre-ordered The Fire TV Stick and it was delivered on the release day-thanks to free 1-day shipping with my Prime Membership. Stick connects to your TV’s HDMI port. Set up was very easy - Just connect stick to power port and HDMI port of TV, enter WI-Fi password and after software update, Amazon Fire TV stick was ready to use in minutes. It even asked me if I want to set up parental controls. It asked me to press Volume Up and Down buttons which in turn successfully paired my TV to the remote and now I can control TV with Amazon remote. The stick came pre-registered to my name and Amazon Account. I didn’t need to do any account set up. I just chose my Amazon account and everything was ready in few minutes. After setup, it played a brief introduction video showing key features of Amazon Fire TV.",309

B079QH9GG,Michael Brown,5.0,"November 5, 2018",true,Crave and Bell TV in Canad do not work on this stick,People buying it as a gift should note that you should make sure that you check “THIS IS A GIFT” option when you add this to the cart. This will ensure that Fire Stick will NOT come pre-registered to your account and gift recipient can register to their own Amazon account. This will ensure that they are not using your account.,213

B07PDHT5X,Chadd H.,4.5,"November 21, 2018",true,Anything less then a 4 Star Review is insane!!!,"Honestly I'm seeing such low reviews for this product and it drives me crazy lol...Alexa isn't going to make a sandwich for you or put your kids to bed! Maybe expectations are a little high lol......  I received my 3 Echo Dot devices for the Black Friday Special...and I'm ready to order 3 more! Installation was incredibly easy, pairing echo dots in groups was incredibly easy, setting reminders, playing Spotify, CBC News briefing, everything is incredible! If your in doubt honestly you will not regret buying these! The packaging is even gorgeous. Sound is great. I have two on my main floor living... Ask Alexa to set volume to 4 or 5 and your rocking! I've been a heavy smart phone user for years, I've had apple, Siri is junk, Google assistant mehhhh... but Alexa.... amazing! Feels like part of the family lol... All jokes aside you will not be disappointed with this purchase!",551
B07PDHT5X,Patrice,5.0,"November 3, 2018",true,Good introduction to our robot overlords,"Decent sound for something the size of a hockey puck. Pretty handy i must say. Keep it in the kitchen, good for timers music, conversions, weather and asking general or even area specific. questions etc. I was surprised how well it picks up voice. Wife still basically can’t fight the instinct to yell at it like an overseas call. My two year old somehow gets her to play whitney houston consistency even though she is speaking gibberish. I’m starting to think its an actual language that only alexa understands. Some free advice: never ask it to play hide and seek, it will never shut up, be warned. Would reccomend to people who aren’t afraid of robots eventually taking over the world. I think it would be a bit overwhelming for my mom’s generation.(no offence to you oldr folks). Thumbs up.",336

Je dois dire que j ai eu de la difficulté due as une erreur de mots de passe de ma part. A moi la faute mais réparer cette erreur n as pas été chose facile après deux appelles aux service technique ça fonctionné. Merci a eux. Ma plus grande déception  a été de voir que je ne pouvais pas faire grand choses avec Alexia. Quand j ai demander ecouter ma musique elle a lancer essais gratuit sur amazon.Donc une fois les 14 jours terminer.Je ne pourrais pas écouter de musique sauf si je paye de la musique que j ai déjà. Pourquoi pas les fameux skills  et bien la coût de génie . Le canada pour votre information est bilingue Anglais et français. Ma province le québec est une des plus grande province et elle est unilingue FRANÇAISE . Vos skills pour le canada français sont presque inexistant a part les flashs de radio canada. ça rend votre Alexa très démunie. Pourtant en france il y as des skill géniaux encore la quelle deception . Je ne peux pas les activer car je suis au canada.

B07PDHT5X,Patrice,5.0,"November 3, 2018",true,Mediocre / Would not recommend,So for the review - the Echo Dot is fantastic. Easy to set up and easy to link my Alexa compatible products. I linked up my Smart Outlet plugs and it is so nice to just tell Alexa to turn on/off my lights as I go from room to room.,165

B07PDHT5X,Constellation ,5.0,"November 5, 2018",true,"Major sound improvement, but some bugs","My only issue is that while in the set up I have a Chinese language option, that option does not work when enabled.

B07PDHT5X,oli,3.0,"October 21, 2018",true,Canadian vs American skills,"I tried to love it, but to be honest, it's pretty mediocre. Sound is pretty bad (expected) but better than previous version. Now the real problem is that it pretty much never does what I ask it to do apart from some really basic stuff. Even then, I need to use a ""robotic""voice for the echo to understand. Also, the app has a really bad design and is not user-friendly.",81

If you haven't seen at least one ""Strange Planet"" comic, I don't know how you've made it this far on the Internet. The way the author puts normal interactions into such an odd perspective is genius. Words take on new meanings, every day items have descriptive names, and old rhymes, sayings, and traditions are twisted into a strange and literal language of their own while still making sense. Impossible to hate, and impossible not to quote.",2

There is a good variety of recipes. Grilled halibut, fennel salad, jambalaya, etc. There’s are about 90-100 recipes.",2

B07M9VX6W,Amazon Customer,1.0,"November 6, 2019",true,it worked!,"I had problems with the installation of the OS - windows updates wouldn't install, problems with drivers and installing some software. This is because the version of Windows 10 I got was an older build version. The solution is to upgrade to a new build using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool. This turned out to be very simple to do. You just have to wait while all the updates on the updates finish installing.  The result was an up to date, stable Win10 installation. The procedure is easily found throigh google search.",3

B0144NYGJ,Likes to listen to radio,4.6,"December 15, 2016",true,WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS!!!!,"Here’s my crazy story that I know is hard to believe but it’s all true.  I purchased this product from Amazon and tried to install it on my computer.  It didn’t work so I called the customer service number on the back of the box.  They explained why it didn’t work, offered to get a refund from Amazon for us, and then sold us a downloadable version instead.  That’s when things went funny.  It started with them claiming they charged us $300 instead of $30.  So they said they’d refund us the money, but it wasn’t working on our credit card.  So let’s try our online banking instead.  We figured we were dealing with Norton so weren’t too concerned about giving them remote access to our banking info.  They said they’d try $100 first to make sure it worked.  That resulted in them “accidentally” depositing $10,000 in our bank account.  We saw the bank account increase by that amount, but now there’s no record of it anywhere.  And through a crazy sequence of events which would be too arduous to try to explain here, we are now missing $10,000 out of our bank account.  We have contacted the police and the anti-fraud hotline.  How this scam could have come from calling Norton, we simply can’t wrap our heads around, but BE CAREFUL!!!!  If things seem suspicious, stop what you’re doing.  We have no idea what further steps we can take with this, but if this warning helps anyone else I’ll be happy.",28
B0144NYGJ,mom24,5.0,"August 8, 2019",true,Great product but cancel the automated renewal as soon as you install,"I have been using Norton antivirus for a very long time and have never had a complaint except cost fore the automated renewal. As soon as you install this software on your first device, the clock starts ticking. You need to register and give them a credit card number if you don't have an account with them to do the install. Once you have registered with Norton, just access your account and cancel the automated renewal so that you won't get a surprise a year from when you first installed. In a year from now, just order Norton from Amazon (at about half the price of the renewal) and go through the procedure again. For me at least, it's worth it.",37
B0144NYGJ,mom24,1.0,"August 8, 2019",true,It works.. but unnecessarily complicated,My computer has not been infected with a virus while using Norton. That is about the only good thing I can say.. and to be fair - it is important.,4
B0144NYGJ,Likes to listen to radio,1.0,"December 15, 2016",true,Slippery marketing,"Unfortunately however, there are a few areas for improvement.",4
B0144NYGJ,Chris,5.0,"May 8, 2019",true,Perfect,1. The product (like a gift card) had to be delivered to my home address... it is software - just send me the download key electronically.,3
B0144NYGJ,Lance Secretan,3.0,"August 1, 2019",true,Peace of Mind Online,"2. The desktop installation process was overly complicated and cumbersome... download, install, uninstall old version of Norton, restart, install again... it took me well over an hour... it could and should be easier....",4

B0144NYGJ,Diana,5.0,"May 30, 2018",true,Thumbs down. Norton not customer-friendly.,4. Cost - buying Norton on Amazon was the most cost effective. Unfortunately- Norton penalizes their existing customers who sign up for auto renewal - I was paying more than double before I realized I could get the same product on Amazon for less than half what I was paying for Norton when it auto renewed... perhaps that is why the installation process is overly complicated...,9

B07FVRYLS,Colin’s Reviews,4.4,"July 12, 2019",true,Microsoft Office for Mac,I had been running Office 2011 up until now. Figured an update of some kind was likely a good idea. Minimal use of most of the features. I mainly compose basic text documents,5
B07FVRYLS,Walter Scott,5.0,"December 14, 2018",true,"Easy to install, good software","2019 downloaded and installed easier than most Microsoft products I have used. Apparently lots more features I won't be using. Application is slow to open each time. Not used to seeing spinning beachball with Office. Bottom line is I do need Office's word processing function, and this one does the job.",2
B07FVRYLS,Walter Scott,3.0,"December 14, 2018",true,This is a SCAM!!!,"My son bought (with some assistance from mom and dad) a new laptop for himself primarily for gaming.  But come September when he starts middle school, we’d like him also to use it for his homework and school projects.  Our household has used MS Office for years so it was our go to software.  Purchased primarily for Word, Excel and PowerPoint should also see some use as well.  It was easy to install, acquired by download from Microsoft after inputting the key code included in the box on their website.  It was also decent value ($139.95 at time of purchase), costing 20 bucks less than buying direct from Microsoft (go figure).",3
